# P0 status — 2026-09-07

Scope: public market data plus authenticated read-only Spot Testnet account access.

- Python target remains 3.12.14; standard library only; no new dependencies.
- Baseline commit: d879e17.
- `uv run --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: **22/22 PASS** (7 existing, 15 new).
- Tests cover an RFC 4231 HMAC vector, signed query/header, env parsing/BOM/quotes/conflicts,
  credential redaction, exact host/path/method restrictions, redirects, disabled ambient proxies,
  malformed/oversized responses, transport errors without retries, Unicode assets and safe CLI output.
- Live `uv run --locked python -m yatl account`: **PASS**, 2026-09-07.
  Validated SPOT summary: 504 assets, 504 with nonzero test balances.
  No raw account payload, amounts, API key, secret or signed URL printed or persisted.
- Initial live response revealed an ASCII-only asset validation assumption. Unicode alphanumeric
  names now pass; control characters remain rejected, with a regression test.
- `.env` remains ignored and unchanged; `.env.example` remains tracked.
- Sandbox access to the existing uv cache failed; tests and live read ran with approved access.
- Earlier public ping and 100 BTCUSDT 1h candle downloads were user-reported successes,
  not repeated in this delivery.

## Enforced boundaries

- Authenticated transport: only GET https://testnet.binance.vision/api/v3/account.
- Required configuration: testnet and LIVE_MASTER_LOCK=OFF. Invalid or conflicting config fails closed.
- No redirects or ambient proxies; default verified TLS; 15-second timeout; 2 MB response limit;
  5-second receive window; no automatic retries; no raw server errors displayed.
- Only a sanitized account summary is returned. Public market data remains credential-free.
- PAPER ONLY; NO FUTURES; NO LEVERAGE; NO WITHDRAWAL API; NO AI DIRECT EXECUTION.
- No order endpoints or permission-changing API calls.

## Limits and next steps

- USER_DATA-only key permissions are user-confirmed in Testnet management. The account response
  does not independently establish key-level TRADE permissions; canTrade describes the account.
  No order request is used to probe permissions.
- Requires a synchronized local clock and direct HTTPS connectivity.
- GitHub remote/CI and historical-data quality checks remain future work.

## Project position reconciliation — 2026-09-07

P0 remains IN PROGRESS / CLOSURE PENDING. Authenticated account access has passed;
P0 as a whole has not been accepted. See [MASTER-PLAN.md](MASTER-PLAN.md) for the
recovered phase sequence, P0 item status and source limitations.
Next: P0-007/008/010 onboarding and manual Paper workflow, then P0 final audit.
No completed Paper trade or verified TradingView Paper session is recorded yet.
Scaffold/config scope and private repository status require reconciliation in that audit.
The previous suggestion to move straight to candle quality (P1) was premature.
This documentation update does not change code, credentials, permissions or execution locks.
